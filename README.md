## 📌 Observations

### ✅ What makes a password strong:
- More than 12 characters.
- Includes **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.
- Avoids repetition or dictionary words.
- Uses unpredictable patterns and placement of characters.

---

## 🧠 Learnings from PasswordMeter Tool

- Short passwords without symbols or uppercase letters are **rated weak**.
- Adding even one symbol or capital letter can increase score drastically.
- Long passphrases using a mix of words and symbols are rated **"Very Strong"** even without being random gibberish.

---

## 🔐 Common Password Attacks

1. **Brute Force Attack**  
   Tries every possible combination to guess your password. Longer + complex = safer.

2. **Dictionary Attack**  
   Uses a list of commonly used passwords and words. Avoid using names, months, simple patterns like `abcd1234`.

3. **Credential Stuffing**  
   If you reuse passwords and one site gets hacked, attackers test your credentials on other sites.

---

## 📢 Importance of Password Length

- Each added character increases time exponentially for brute-force attacks.
- A 6-character password may take seconds to crack, while a 16+ character password can take **millions of years** if well-composed.

---

## 🧩 What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

An additional layer of security (e.g., OTP, fingerprint) after entering a password.  
Even if your password gets leaked, MFA stops unauthorized access.

---

## 🧰 How Password Managers Help

- Generate strong random passwords.
- Save them securely with encryption.
- No need to remember all passwords.
- Examples: Bitwarden, KeePassXC, LastPass.

---

## ✍️ What Are Passphrases?

- A passphrase is a sequence of words or sentence that is easy to remember but hard to crack.
  Example: `MyDog$EatsIceCream@12PM`
- Much stronger and more memorable than short complex strings.

---

## ❌ Common Password Mistakes

- Using names, DOB, `123456`, `password`, etc.
- Reusing the same password on multiple sites.
- Keeping passwords too short.
- No symbols or case variation.
